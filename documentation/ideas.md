- Students get a mastery certificate when they complete the full course.
- Students get stickers for each activity they complete (ninja, wizzard, etc.)
- Experts first create tests for their home group. Then all students do central assessment.
- Central assessment is done by instructors per home group.
- Experts are assessed on the overall performance of their home group.
- Using score variance directly in the grading formula as an automated diagnostic tool for the instructor. Set up the system to flag any group whose quiz scores have a standard deviation above a certain threshold. This flag wouldn't affect the grade, but it would serve as an alert for the instructor to check in with that group, observe their dynamics, and provide targeted support. This provides valuable insight without making the grading scheme overly complex or potentially unfair.
- Instructor does not need to assess each student weekly, but can randomly select students to assess each week.
